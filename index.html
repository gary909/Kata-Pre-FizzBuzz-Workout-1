    <p>
        This is the first step to understanding FizzBuzz.<br>
        <br>
        Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater than or equal to one. n is provided, <br>
        you have NO CONTROL over its value.<br>
        <br>
        Your expected output is an array of positive integers from 1 to n (inclusive).<br>
        <br>
        Your job is to write an algorithm that gets you from the input to the output.<br>
